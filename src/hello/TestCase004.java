//   1. This will create `origin/tc004`
//   2. Create connection between `tc004` and `origin/tc004`
//   3. Push all the commits from `tc004` to `origin/tc004`
//7. Now From GitHub.com repository main page We Open a request to merge our `origin/tc004` branch to `origin/master`
//8. Such Request is known as `Pull Request` (really wished they called it `Merge Request` because it is)

//   5.  Give some detail on the work been done
//       1.  cool code here
//       2.  cool code there
//       3.  cool code everywhere
//   6.  Click Create and now you have a open request.
//   7.  This is where team can review your code and comment on your code or approve the changes and eventually merge this code to `origin/master` if all is well
//   8.  One merge is complete , go back to your IntelliJ, checkout master and pull down all the changes happened in `origin/master`
